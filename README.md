# Global-Terrorism-Analysis

This project uses Power BI to visualize and analyze global terrorism data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The Power BI dashboard provides insights into terrorist attacks worldwide, focusing on the success rate of different attack types, weapons, terrorist groups, and regions, along with key summary statistics for a comprehensive understanding of global terrorism patterns.

# Project Overview
The Global Terrorism Analysis dashboard presents an interactive visual analysis of terrorism data. It highlights important trends and success rates of attacks based on factors like attack type, weapon type, terrorist group, region, and target type. The dashboard also includes key insights, such as the most deadly terrorist group, most commonly used weapons, and the years with the highest number of attacks.

# Key Features
Success Rate by Types of Attack: Visualizes the success rate of various types of attacks (e.g., bombings, armed assaults, hijackings).

Success Rate by Weapon Type: Displays the success rate for different weapon types used in terrorist attacks.

Success Rate by Terrorist Group: Analyzes the success rate of terrorist attacks by group.

Success Rate by Target Type: Shows the success rate of attacks based on the type of target (e.g., government, civilian, military).

Success Rate by Region: Compares success rates of terrorist attacks across different regions of the world.

Count of Attacks by Year: A time-series analysis showing the number of terrorist attacks each year, revealing trends in terrorist activity.

Multi-Row Card:- Displays key metrics such as:

Most Deadly Group: The terrorist group responsible for the highest number of fatalities.

Most Used Weapons: The weapons most commonly used in terrorist attacks.

Maximum Attacks in a Year: The year with the highest number of terrorist attacks.

Total Target Types: The total number of distinct target types affected by terrorism.

# Dataset
This project uses the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is publicly available and contains information about terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 to the present. The dataset includes:

Country, Region, and Location of the attack

Date and Time of the attack

Attack Type (e.g., bombing, armed assault)

Weapons Used

Terrorist Group Responsible

Target Type (e.g., government, military, civilians)

Casualties and Fatalities


# Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI: Used to build the interactive dashboard and visualizations.

Excel/CSV: For handling and importing the raw dataset into Power BI.
